# Release Automation

This document describes how maintainers prepare, publish, install, and verify `gate-agent` releases.

## Goals

Releases must be reproducible from a clean checkout at one git tag. Automation must fail before publishing when source validation, build, packaging, or checksum generation fails.

## Supported release assets

Each published release must include these versioned archives:

- `gate-agent-vX.Y.Z-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-vX.Y.Z-linux-x64-musl.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-vX.Y.Z-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-vX.Y.Z-sha256sums.txt`

Prerelease versions use the same shape with the prerelease suffix, for example `gate-agent-v1.2.3-beta-linux-x64.tar.gz`.

Each published stable release must also include stable latest aliases:

- `gate-agent-latest-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-latest-linux-x64-musl.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-latest-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
- `gate-agent-latest-sha256sums.txt`

The stable latest aliases are uploaded to stable releases only. Prereleases are marked as GitHub prereleases, do not update GitHub's latest release pointer, and publish only versioned assets. Stable releases explicitly update GitHub's latest release pointer. Release verification must run the installer from the release tag, for example `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazyEggInc/gate-agent/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | VERSION=X.Y.Z sh`, so the installer logic and downloaded artifacts come from the same immutable release. The installer uses GitHub's `releases/latest/download` URLs only when `VERSION` is omitted, and versioned `releases/download/vX.Y.Z` or `releases/download/vX.Y.Z-prerelease` URLs when `VERSION` is set.

## Installer contract

The repository root includes `install.sh` for public hosting through GitHub raw content. Release verification and pinned installs should use the tag-scoped script URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazyEggInc/gate-agent/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z/install.sh` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazyEggInc/gate-agent/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z-prerelease/install.sh`.

The installer must:

- run under POSIX `sh`
- support Linux x64 glibc, Linux x64 musl, and macOS ARM64, matching release assets
- select `linux-x64-musl` on Linux x64 only when musl libc is positively detected
- preserve `linux-x64` on Linux x64 glibc or unknown libc environments
- download the archive and checksum manifest for the selected release
- verify the selected archive before installing
- install to `~/.local/bin/gate-agent` by default
- add the install directory to the user's shell `PATH` when needed
- support `VERSION=X.Y.Z`, `VERSION=vX.Y.Z`, `VERSION=X.Y.Z-prerelease`, or `VERSION=vX.Y.Z-prerelease` for pinned installs
- support `GATE_AGENT_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/bin` for alternate install directories

Stable release tags use `vX.Y.Z` and map to download paths under `releases/download/vX.Y.Z`. Prerelease tags use `vX.Y.Z-prerelease` and map to download paths under `releases/download/vX.Y.Z-prerelease`.

## Checksum contract

The versioned checksum file contains checksums for versioned archive filenames only.

Example:

```text
<sha256>  gate-agent-v1.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz
<sha256>  gate-agent-v1.2.3-linux-x64-musl.tar.gz
<sha256>  gate-agent-v1.2.3-macos-arm64.tar.gz
```

The latest checksum file contains checksums for latest alias filenames only.

Example:

```text
<sha256>  gate-agent-latest-linux-x64.tar.gz
<sha256>  gate-agent-latest-linux-x64-musl.tar.gz
<sha256>  gate-agent-latest-macos-arm64.tar.gz
```

This keeps `sha256sum --check` and `shasum -a 256 -c` compatible without renaming files locally.

## Prepare release workflow

Maintainers prepare a release through GitHub Actions workflow `prepare release`.

Inputs:

- `version`: semantic version without `v`, for example `1.2.3` or `1.2.3-beta`
- `ref`: source ref to release, default `master`
- `dry_run`: when `true`, validate only and do not push the version bump or create a tag

The workflow validates:

1. version matches `X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z-prerelease`
2. tag `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-prerelease` does not already exist
3. `Cargo.toml` can be bumped with `cargo set-version` and `Cargo.lock` can be refreshed with `cargo metadata`
4. source passes `cargo fmt --all --check`
5. source passes `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
6. source passes `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`

When `dry_run=false`, the workflow commits the `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` version bump to the selected branch, creates annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-prerelease` at that commit, pushes both, and dispatches the release workflow for the tag. Non-dry runs require `ref` to be a branch that can receive the version bump.

## Release workflow

The release workflow runs on pushed tags matching `v*.*.*` and through manual dispatch. The prepare release workflow uses manual dispatch after it pushes a tag, because GitHub does not start push-triggered workflows from tags pushed with the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

For a real tag release, the workflow:

1. checks out the tagged commit
2. verifies tag format and `Cargo.toml` version
3. runs formatting, clippy, and tests
4. builds optimized Linux x64 glibc, Linux x64 musl, and macOS ARM64 binaries
5. creates versioned archives and stable latest alias archives
6. creates versioned and latest checksum manifests
7. creates or reuses the GitHub release for the tag, marking tags with a prerelease suffix as GitHub prereleases without updating the latest release pointer
8. uploads versioned artifacts for all releases and stable latest alias artifacts for stable releases only, using `--clobber` so retries replace partial uploads

## Failure and recovery

Validation, build, and packaging failures happen before publish and are safe to fix in repository code before creating a new tag.

Publish failures may leave a release record or partial assets. Re-run the failed workflow for the same tag first. Because uploads use `--clobber`, retry is safe for transient GitHub or network failures. If incorrect artifacts were already consumed, create a corrective version tag rather than rewriting public history.

## Manual verification

After a release publishes:

```sh
TAG=vX.Y.Z
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json tagName,targetCommitish,assets
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrazyEggInc/gate-agent/refs/tags/${TAG}/install.sh" | VERSION="$TAG" GATE_AGENT_INSTALL_DIR="$(pwd)/verify-bin" sh
./verify-bin/gate-agent version
```

## Container verification

The root Dockerfile builds the checked-out source using the locked dependencies and a pinned Rust
builder. Its runtime contains only the binary and CA certificates, runs as `nobody` by default, and
expects a readable configuration mounted at `/app/.secrets`. Run with the non-root host user's UID
and GID to read a host-owned `0600` configuration. Configure `server.bind = "0.0.0.0"` for access
through a published container port.

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t gate-agent:local .
docker run --rm gate-agent:local version
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 -v "$PWD/.secrets:/app/.secrets:ro" gate-agent:local
```

The `examples/docker` image remains a released-binary deployment template with AWS CLI and shell
tools for custom configuration setup. Build from that directory with `--build-arg VERSION=X.Y.Z`;
the installer and archive both come from that release tag. Its default is 0.0.8, so it will not
contain later source dependency fixes until a new release is published and selected explicitly.

Direct Cargo dependencies use exact version requirements; keep Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock synchronized.
The minimum supported Rust version is 1.88 because the patched `time` dependency requires it;
the development/build toolchain remains pinned to 1.94.1.
